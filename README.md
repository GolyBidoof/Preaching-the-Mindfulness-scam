Preaching the Mindfulness Scam

And tomorrow i also kept the audience  
Of zero raccoons  
Half of them are really savvy, the other have smarts  
Except for this one out of the balcony  
I do not wish to be a part of the  
Creative process inventing excuses  
As for why one can not go for an oatmeal soup  
It’s too healthy, and that’s part of the problem  
The caffeine contents will >not< satiate the audience as it  
Surely expects something that would keep them awake  
In the world of go to sleep already;  
Watch as i do this  
Crazy intricate backflip of not contributing to hopes and dreams  
And see the Duolingo owl come crawling at me out of nowhere  
(i knew she would come)  
The raccoons must have a  
Positive track record against digital owls  
They could scratch for once,  
Two, if they felt like that could get immortalized  
By this white shirt guy making goofy expressions  
To every scandal of national importance  
Assuming it’s big enough for the audience to clap  
With all their a few hands and all their a few legs  
I can’t count how many  
I only have enough fingers to count the audience of mine  
A special treat for each  
Mutual i definitely deem worthy of respect and recognition  
I’m sure they’ll all appreciate an oatmeal soup  
I spent an hour trying it on and i think it’s doing a perfect job at being too healthy (bleh)  
I (don’t) make the rules and this is a (no) caffeine household  
Raccoon #2 clapped! I’m sure she would! Maybe!  
That’ll just suffice until yesterday i hope
